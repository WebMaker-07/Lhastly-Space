        I am Proffer Lhastly Faner, dreaming to be a developer. I graduate in Mindoro State
        University  with Bachelor of Science in Information and Techonology on August 5, 2022.
        It's been 1 year after my graduation and I'm still unemployed and feel lost to become
        a web developer. I joined bootcamp in KODEGO on January 2023 and finised on May 2023.
        During the bootcamp, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Nodejs, React, Git and 
        and other strategy in coding. I'm losing my confidence as a developer right now. While
        search I found UX /UI designing which involve more front end role and I learned Figma
        for UI/UX Designing. But I don't enjoy doing it I love the backend part database and 
        programming but with the challenges I still feel dumb and cant solve it without help of 
        the internet. I'm solo programmer I dont have buddy to be with in this journey. Today
        I still fighting to my dreams, I creating this space to continue and rebuild again. 
        Hope before I turn 25 this year in July 12, 2024 I have chance to start this career in 
        real world. At April 17 I will have exam in DICT about programming I hope I passed the exam.
        I really want to have job this year in order to help my family in the expenses and buy
        my mother she want. I don't give up never.!! Goodluck my future self in your journey.
